# less-simple-banking
This has added a stock brokering system to simple-banking.

Python 3.13+

Again, this is not recommended for a serious project. We reccomend it be used as practice for white-hat hackers and to be used in schools to teach about financial transactions. 

## Dependencies 

server.py:
<code>pip install flask cryptography hashlib</code>

client.py:
<code>pip install requests cryptography</code>

Also needed (likely pre-installed)
<code>tkinter</code>
<code>os</code>
<code>random</code>

## Features

Alongside the features in simple-banking, this has added the option for an account to become a public company, and allows for the buying of these company's shares by any account.

## Next Update

The next update will be adding automatic share price tracking and line charts.

We... hope. Hope.
